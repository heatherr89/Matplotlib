# Matplotlib
Python lesson on using Matplotlib for Women Who Code DC

It was a pleasure sharing what I knew about Python and Matplotlib with other women at Women Who Code DC. 
I very much appreciated the opportunity to teach. It is a wonderful organization to be a part of and to learn from other women. 

Using the traffic violations data from Montgomery County (https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/), I provided examples on how to graph the data to women who were learning how to use Python.
